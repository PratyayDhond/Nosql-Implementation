This is the Manual Page for NoSQL implementation project using C language.

Available Data-Types:
---------------------
    - INTEGER
    - DOUBLE
    - BOOLEAN
    - CHARACTER
    - STRING

Syntax and Symantics:
----------------------
        The program follows a very specific syntax designed for optimal user experience. The data types would be automatically parsed based on the user's input type, thus there would be no need for the user to input the Data-Types manually.

    SYNTAX:
        - INTEGER
            <SYNTAX> key:(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0)*
            for the value to be an INTEGER the value should consists of only decimal number
        - DOUBLE
            <SYNTAX> key:(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0)* . (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0)*
            for the value to be an DOUBLE the value should consists of only decimal number AND at least one '.' (period)

        - STRING
            <SYNTAX> key:"value"
            for the value to be an STRING, the value can contain any characters from a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and special characters. The only rule here is that the string must be enclosed withing double quotes.

        - CHARACTER
            <SYNTAX> key:'value'
            for the value to be a CHARACTER, the value must contain one and only one CHARACTER, also it should be enclosed by single quotes.

        - BOOLEAN
            <SYNTAX> key:(T + F)
            for the value to be a BOOLEAN, it must be a single character either T or F.
            These characters SHOULD NOT BE enclosed in any quotes.

Available Commands:
-------------------

- login:
           Used to invoke the login procedure.
           On usage of this command the terminal will be cleared and user will be redirected to a login page.
           <SYNTAX> => `login`

- logout:
           Used to logout of the current session safely.
           If user doesn't use logout to quit, there might be some losses of the unsaved recent data, hence it is recommended for the user to logout.
           <SYNTAX> => `logout`
- ls users:
           Used to list all the users that have made account in the database.
           This command is made for users who might forget their usernames and want to access the list
           <SYNTAX> => `ls users`
           
- ls collections:
           List all the available collections for the current user.
           To use this command, the user must be logged in.
           <SYNTAX> => `ls collections` OR `ls cols`

- ls documents:
           Used to list all the documents in the users current collection
           For this command to work, the user must have already selected a collection.
           <SYNTAX> => `ls documents` or `ls docs`
           
- use document:
           Used to select a particular document with document name provided by the user.
           A document needs to be selected before performing CRUD operations.
           All the CRUD operations will occur on the last selected document.
           <SYNTAX> => `use document DOCUMENT_NAME`
           
- use collection:
           Used to select a particular collection with COLLECTION_NAME provided by the user.
           A collection must be selected before selecting a document.
           All the newly created documents will be saved in the last selected collection.
           <SYNTAX> => `use collection COLLECTION_NAME`
- man:
           Used to Invoke the Manual Page instruction
