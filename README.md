# Nosql-Implementation
DSA-2 Project

Implementation of a No-SQL like Database using C programming language which supports multiple users, creation of multiple collections and documents for each user.

All the data in the project is encrypted and so is the password. 
There are two encryption algos used in the project one for encryption of data (Ceaser Cipher Modified) and one for encryption of passwords(PolyAplhabetic Encryption).
